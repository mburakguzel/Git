Assume we create new files or make some changes in a new branch, If we switch to master branch without
committing these changes, there are two scenarios:
1) My changes come with me to master branch (if branch is changed, master is same)
2) Git will not let me to switch if it detects potential conflicts (if master is changed, branch is same)

When they come with us to master, if we go back to branch amd commit, they will not come with us anymore.

STASH
stash means zulalamak, iyi bir yere saklamak
When we make some changes but want to switch to another branch without commiting:
git stash // saves all (unstaged,staged) changes for us to come back later. This is not COMMIT!
git stash save // saves all (unstaged,staged) changes for us to come back later. This is not COMMIT!

git stash pop // deletes the stash and reapplies them to the branch I am in!

git stash apply // applies the stash but keeps the stash, does not delete it!

MULTIPLE STASHES (DO not use soo much!)
We can have multiple stashes.
git stash list // shows us our stashes

git stash apply stash@{2} // applies stash number 2

git stash pop // deletes the stash and reapplies the latest stash!

CLEAR STASH

deletes all stashes
