DIFF
git diff // shows us all the changes in our working directory that are not STAGED for next commit

git diff HEAD // shows all unstaged and staged changes, since HEAD!

git diff HEAD filename // only shows the changes in this specific file

git diff --staged // shows the diffs between staged files and last commit
git diff --cached // shows the diffs between staged files and last commit

git diff --staged filename // only shows staged changes in this specific file

COMPARE BRANCHES
git diff branch1 branch2 // compares branches, branch1 -> a, branch2 -> b
git diff branch1.. branch2 // compares branches, branch1 -> a, branch2 -> b


git diff only shows us a small chunk of the code, where changes were made as described below:
After diff command;
1st line shows which files are being compared.
2nd line is not important!
------- a/filename.txt // - indicates a (last commit)
+++++++ b/filename.txt // + indicates b (working directory)
@@ -3,4 +3,5 @@ \\ -3,4 means 4 lines have been extracted starting from line 3 in file a
                \\ +3,5 means 5 lines have been extracted starting from line 3 in file b
                green means added (usually new)
                red means deleted (usually old)

When a new file added git diff shows us:
----/dev/null // means this file did not exist in last commit
++++/filename.txt // the file which does not exist in the last commit
