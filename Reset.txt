RESET 
git reset commithash // deletes the commits that are performed after this commit, and moves back to the commit.
But it keeps the changes done after the commit in workingdirectory

Only deletes commits done after this commit, But changes done in deleted commits still will be in working directory.

This command can be used if you make a commit in wrong branch and carry ur changes to the correct branch.

git reset -- hard commithash // deletes both commits and changes.
git reset -- hard HEAD~1 // deletes both commits and changes.

Only deletes from the current branch, not from other branches.
