If you push a directory to github very first time, you need to create an empty repo at GitHub first!

git push remotename branchname // for all online repos!
Ex: git push origin master

Most of the people names their main branch as main, since github uses the same.

git push remotename branchname // Creates a new branch in remote and copies our local repo to there.
From now on, our changes in local machine will go to the branch named as same as the branch in our local machine.

We can also copy our local branch to remote repo with a different name:
git push remotename localbranchname:differentnamethatwewant

PUSH
git push -u remotename master // pushes master to remote and matches our master with remotes master.
We can push by only git push from now on!

git push -u remotename localbranch:remotebranch
git push // after the above command git push, always pushes localbranch to remotebranch
