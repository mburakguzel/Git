Workspace   ==>   Staging Index     ==>     Local Repo    ==>   Remote Repo
                                                          <==
                                                       git fetch
            <================================================
                             git pull

git pull = git fetch + git merge // applies to both workspace and local repo

git pull remotename branchname // takes remotename/branchname and merges it to my current branch!
Can cause merge conflicts as git merge, solve them before pull!
When there is merge conflicts for pull request, first fetch, solve them on your local machine than merge!

git pull // if I am on master branch it will pull remotename/master to master.
This also works with any branch with the same name!
