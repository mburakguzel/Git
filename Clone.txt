We can clone repos from gitbucket or any other online repo!

CLONE
git clone URL // initialize a git repo in our local directory and copies all commits(history) to our machine.
Also creates a new folder in local directory with the name of the repo in URL.

Any repo we can open and see in Github can be clonned.

When we clone a remote repo and type git branch, git shows us only main branch, not other branches on online repo

git checkout remotename/branchname // switches to the branchname from remote

git switch branchname // creates a local branch with branchname and sets it up to track with the remote branch remotename/branchname
branchname must be same!
git checkout --track remotename/branchname // creates a local branch with branchname and sets it up to track with the remote branch remotename/branchname
branchname must be same!
