We can clone repos from gitbucket or any other online repo!

CLONE
git clone URL // initialize a git repo in our local directory and copies all commits(history) to our machine.
Also creates a new folder in local directory with the name of the repo in URL.

Any repo we can open and see in Github can be clonned.
