git status // shows us on which branch we are currently working on

Master branch has no extra capabilities compared to other branches. However, in projects it is accepted as the master branch of the project!

Github names master branch as main after 2020. Therefore, change your master branches name to main if you work with github. Or change default master branch name on github!

git log // shows HEAD -> main. This is kind of a pointer which shows on which branch this commit has been done.
The last commit of a branch is called HEAD!

CHECKING BRANCHES
git branch // shows us all the branches that we have in our repo!
The branch that we are working on is showed with a asterix(*) before it and in green colour.

CREATE NEW BRANCH
git branch branchname // creates a branch

git switch -c branchname // creates a new branch and switches to there

git checkout -b branchname  // creates a new branch and switches to there

SWITCH TO ANOTHER BRANCH
git switch branchname // to switch another 

git checkout branchname // also switches to another branch (old-school)
