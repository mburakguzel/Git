git status // shows us on which branch we are currently working on

Master branch has no extra capabilities compared to other branches. However, in projects it is accepted as the master branch of the project!

Github names master branch as main after 2020. Therefore, change your master branches name to main if you work with github. Or change default master branch name on github!

git log // shows HEAD -> main. This is kind of a pointer which shows on which branch this commit has been done.
The last commit of a branch is called HEAD!

CHECKING BRANCHES
git branch // shows us all the branches that we have in our repo!
The branch that we are working on is showed with a asterix(*) before it and in green colour.

CREATE NEW BRANCH
git branch branchname // creates a branch

git switch -c branchname // creates a new branch and switches to there

git checkout -b branchname  // creates a new branch and switches to there

It is possible to go back to an older commit and create a branch there! (check Oldercommits.txt)

SWITCH TO ANOTHER BRANCH
git switch branchname // to switch another 

git checkout branchname // also switches to another branch (old-school)

When we make some changes on a branch, we can not not switch to another branch without commiting the changes.
Otherwise, we will loose the changes.

When we create a new file which is not present in other branches, that file will follow us to the 
branch that we switch. It will follow us wherever we switch.

git switch - // goes back to the previous branch that we were in, before we switch to the branch! 

DELETE BRANCH
git branch -d branchname // deletes the branch 
git branch --delete branchname // deletes the branch 

We can not delete a branch when we are in it! Need to switch to another branch.

git branch -D // forces to delete branch

RENAME BRANCH

git branch -M newname // renames the branch that we are in. Must be done in the branch that we want to rename
git branch -m oldname newname // renames oldname as newname

DETAILS
In .git directory refs/heads/branchname shows us the commit hash of that branch`s HEAD (last commit)

File whose name is HEAD shows the current branch that we are in.

COMPARE BRANCHES
git diff branch1 branch2 // compares branches, branch1 -> a, branch2 -> b
git diff branch1.. branch2 // compares branches, branch1 -> a, branch2 -> b
