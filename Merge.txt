We merge branches, not commits!

MERGE
git merge branchname // merges the branchname to the branch that we are in.

In order to merge, first we need to switch to the branch that we want to continue,
then merge the other branch to this branch.

Merge does not delete the merged branch.

Merge does not mean these two branches are synched. If we make any changes in merged branch, 
it will not show up at master.

O---O----O_         master    // merging new branch to master is a fast forward merge.
          |_----O   newbranch

O---O----O_--O--O--O---O        master    // merging new branch to master is a fast forward merge.
          |_----O--O---|        newbranch

Git creates a new commit to master, that commit has two parent commits (the commits done just before merge)
Since Git creates a new commit it asks for a commit message!

MERGE CONFLICTS

If there are merge conflicts, GIT will give us an error that there are merge conflicts and ask us to fix them.

Git will show the conflicts in on default text editor.

On VScode, we can delete the lines from merged conflicts, or from master, with a buttoon!
Or we can manuplate them accordingly.
