If you made changes on files by mistake but nit want to commit:
1) Delete all new files created.
2) git checkout HEAD filename // copies the filename from last commit to workspace!
   git checkout -- // copies the filename from last commit to workspace!

RESTORE
git restore filename // discards changes from the file since the last commit. (Same as git checkout HEAD filename given above!)

git restore --source HEAD~1 filename // copies filename from commit HEAD~1 to current workspace
Also means discard the changes, that are applied after this commit, from the file 

git restore filename // brings discarted changes back!

git restore --staged filename // discards staged
