fetch means  to go to where somebody/something is and bring them/it back
Ex: The inhabitants have to walk a mile to fetch water.
    She's gone to fetch the kids from school.

          git add               git commit             git push
Workspace   ==>   Staging Index     ==>     Local Repo    ==>   Remote Repo
                                                          <==
                                                       git fetch
            <================================================
                             git pull


git fetch remotename // fetch brings the remote repo to our local repo not to workspace (all branches)

git fetch remotename branchname // brings only branchname to our local repo not to workspace 

fetch creates a new branch as remotename/branchname, does not effect our branch with the same name!

git checkout remotename/branchname // switches to fetched branch!

If a fetched branch does not exist in local, git synches it automatically even with workspace!

If change are made on remote repo and you type git status in your local machine, it will say that your branch is up to date with remotename/branch.
However it is not true because it compares with the remotename/branch from clone! 
When you type git status after fetch, git says your branch is behind one commit and can be fast-forwarded.
